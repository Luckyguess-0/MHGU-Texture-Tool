# MHGU-Texture-Tool
This tool replaces textures in .Arc files for MHGU. It scans each arc in the target directory and replaces any textures with the same name. It can look though the entire NativeNX folder if the exact location of your replacement is not known or there are multiple replacements to be done.

The large file size is due to the tool requiring the NILabVIEW Runtime 2020 SP1. A version of the installer without the runtime is included if you already have it. 

A readme is included in the data folder that explains how to use the tool.
