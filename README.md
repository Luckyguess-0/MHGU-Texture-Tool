# MHGU-Texture-Tool
This tool replaces textures in .Arc files for MHGU. It scans each arc in the target directory and replaces any textures with the same name. It can look though the entire NativeNX folder if the exact location of your replacement is not known or there are multiple replacements to be done.

The large file size is due to the tool requiring the NI Runtime Componets. A version of the installer without the runtime componets is included if you already have it. If you installed my Charm Exporter you probably do. 

A readme is included in the data folder that explains how to use the tool.

I am trying something different with my compiling method so your OS may be unhappy about a digital certificate or maybe something else. It works fine on mine of course but that doesn't matter much. Make an issue if you'd like if that occurs.
